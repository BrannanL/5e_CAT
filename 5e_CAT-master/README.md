Combat Action Tracker

As a DM who has in the past brought in brand new players to TTRPGs, I have seen that they can sometimes have difficulty keeping track of everything they can do in a given turn. The goal of this app is to give such players, or even veteran players, an easy and quick way to know their characters' capabilities. 

This will be a mobile (Android only currently) app which can be used to track actions during a combat encounter in DnD 5e. 
The user will be given a short series of selection screens for their character's race, class, abilities, and spells
Once these have been selected the end result will be a screen containing the players available actions.

These actions will be grouped by type (Bonus, Regular, Movement, Free, Item, Reaction).
When such an action is selected, the player loses that action type for the rest of their turn, unless it was a free action.
Once a player is out of possible or desired actions, they can then select the end turn function, which will then reset their actions
Spells and Abilities that have cooldowns will be tracked and unusable until their cooldowns are complete.
I hope to also include spell slot tracking but that will likely be only after completing the above.

Anyone who stumbles across this is more than welcome to contibute or criticize. I'm doing this primarily to improve my programming so please let me know anything I could be doing better.

Thanks,
